Given a directed graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E directed edges, represented as a 2D array edges[][], where each element edges[i] = [u, v] represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v. Return all Safe Nodes of the graph.
A vertex with no outgoing edges is called a terminal node. A vertex is considered safe if every path starting from it eventually reaches a terminal node.

Examples: 

Input: V = 5, E = 6, edges[][] = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: 4 and 0 is the terminal node, and all the paths from 1, 2, 3 lead to terminal node, i.e., 4.
Input: V = 4, E = 3, edges[][] = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 2]]

Output: [0]
Explanation: 0 is the terminal node, and no other node than 0 leads to 0.
Constraints:
1 ≤ V ≤ 105
0 ≤ E ≤ 105
0 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < V

        graph = [[] for _ in range(V)]
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
        
        # States: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting (gray), 2 = safe (black)
        state = [0] * V
        
        def dfs(node):
            # If already visiting this node, we found a cycle
            if state[node] == 1:
                return False
            
            # If already processed and safe
            if state[node] == 2:
                return True
            
            # Mark as visiting (gray)
            state[node] = 1
            
            # Check all neighbors
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not dfs(neighbor):
                    # If any neighbor is unsafe, current node is unsafe
                    return False
            
            # All neighbors are safe, mark current as safe (black)
            state[node] = 2
            return True
        
        # Process all nodes
        result = []
        for i in range(V):
            if dfs(i):
                result.append(i)
        
        return result
