Given two strings pat and txt which may be of different sizes, You have to return true if the wildcard pattern i.e. pat, matches with txt else return false.

The wildcard pattern pat can include the characters '?' and '*'.

'?' – matches any single character.
'*' – matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
Note: The matching should cover the entire txt (not partial txt).

Examples:

Input: txt = "abcde", pat = "a?c*"
Output: true
Explanation: '?' matches with 'b' and '*' matches with "de".
Input: txt = "baaabab", pat = "a*ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The pattern starts with a, but the text starts with b, so the pattern does not match the text.
Input: txt = "abc", pat = "*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches with whole text "abc".
Constraints:
1 ≤ txt.size(), pat.size() ≤ 100
class Solution:
    # Approach 1: Dynamic Programming (More intuitive)
    def wildCard(self, txt, pat):
        n, m = len(txt), len(pat)
        
        # Create DP table
        dp = [[False] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        # Base case: empty pattern matches empty text
        dp[0][0] = True
        
        # Handle patterns with leading '*' characters
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            if pat[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1]
        
        # Fill the DP table
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                if pat[j - 1] == '*':
                    # '*' can match empty sequence or one or more characters
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] or dp[i - 1][j]
                elif pat[j - 1] == '?' or pat[j - 1] == txt[i - 1]:
                    # '?' matches any single character or exact match
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
        
        return dp[n][m]
