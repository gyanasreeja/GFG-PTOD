Given a string of balanced expression s, check if it contains a redundant parenthesis or not. A set of parenthesis are redundant if the same sub-expression is surrounded by unnecessary or multiple brackets.

Examples:

Input: s = "((a+b))"
Output: true 
Explanation: ((a+b)) can reduced to (a+b).
Input: s = "(a+(b)/c)"
Output: true
Explanation: (a+(b)/c) can reduced to (a+b/c) because b is surrounded by () which is redundant.
Input: s = "(a+b+(c+d))"
Output: false
Explanation:(a+b+(c+d)) doesn't have any redundant or multiple brackets.
Constraints:
1 ≤ |s| ≤105
Solution:
class Solution():
    def checkRedundancy(self, s):
        stack = []

        for ch in s:
            if ch == ')':
                has_operator = False

                # Check contents inside the parentheses
                while stack and stack[-1] != '(':
                    if stack[-1] in '+-*/':
                        has_operator = True
                    stack.pop()

                stack.pop()  # remove '('

                # If no operator found, brackets are redundant
                if not has_operator:
                    return True
            else:
                stack.append(ch)

        return False
