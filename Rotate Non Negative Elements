 You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
Rotate only the non-negative elements of the array to the left by k positions, in a cyclic manner. All negative elements must stay in their original positions and must not move. 
After rotation, place the non-negative elements back into the array in the new order, filling only the positions that originally contained non-negative values and skipping all negative positions. Return the resulting array. 
Example 1: Input: nums = [1,-2,3,-4], k = 3 Output: [3,-2,1,-4] Explanation:​​​​​​​The non-negative elements, in order, are [1, 3]. Left rotation with k = 3 results in: [1, 3] -> [3, 1] -> [1, 3] -> [3, 1] Placing them back into the non-negative indices results in [3, -2, 1, -4].
Example 2: Input: nums = [-3,-2,7], k = 1 Output: [-3,-2,7] Explanation: The non-negative elements, in order, are [7]. Left rotation with k = 1 results in [7]. 
Placing them back into the non-negative indices results in [-3, -2, 7].
Example 3: Input: nums = [5,4,-9,6], k = 2 Output: [6,5,-9,4] Explanation: The non-negative elements, in order, are [5, 4, 6]. Left rotation with k = 2 results in [6, 5, 4].
Placing them back into the non-negative indices results in [6, 5, -9, 4]. Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 105 -105 <= nums[i] <= 105 0 <= k <= 105 optimal solution
solution:
class Solution(object):
    def rotateNonNegative(self, nums, k):

        # Step 1: Collect non-negative elements
        pos = []
        for x in nums:
            if x >= 0:
                pos.append(x)

        m = len(pos)

        # If 0 or 1 non-negative elements → no change
        if m <= 1:
            return nums

        # Step 2: Reduce k
        k = k % m

        # Step 3: Rotate left
        pos = pos[k:] + pos[:k]

        # Step 4: Put back
        idx = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] >= 0:
                nums[i] = pos[idx]
                idx += 1

        return nums
