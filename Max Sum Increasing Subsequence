Given an array of positive integers arr[], find the maximum sum of a subsequence such that the elements of the subsequence form a strictly increasing sequence.
In other words, among all strictly increasing subsequences of the array, return the one with the largest possible sum.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 101, 2, 3, 100]
Output: 106
Explanation: The maximum sum of an increasing sequence is obtained from [1, 2, 3, 100].
Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 2, 3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximum sum of an increasing sequence is obtained from [1, 2, 3].
Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 2, 4]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum sum of an increasing sequence is obtained from [1, 2, 4].
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 103
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
Solution:
class Solution:
    def maxSumIS(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        
        # dp[i] will store the maximum sum of increasing subsequence
        # ending at index i
        dp = arr.copy()  # Initialize with array values
        
        # Build the dp array
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                # If arr[j] < arr[i], we can extend the subsequence ending at j
                if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[i])
        
        # Return the maximum sum from all possible subsequences
        return max(dp
