The Celebrity Problem

A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. A party is being organized by some people. A square matrix mat[][] of size n*n is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party, if the celebrity does not exist, return -1.

Note: Follow 0-based indexing.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1, 0],
                [0, 1, 0],
                [0, 1, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both know 1st person and 1st person does not know anyone. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity person.
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1], 
                [1, 1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since both the people at the party know each other. Hence none of them is a celebrity person.
Input: mat[][] = [[1]]
Output: 0
Constraints:
1 ≤ mat.size() ≤ 1000
0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 1
mat[i][i] = 1

Soluction:
class Solution:
    def celebrity(self, mat):
        n = len(mat)
        
        # Step 1: Find potential celebrity candidate
        # Use elimination technique - if person A knows person B, 
        # then A cannot be celebrity. If A doesn't know B, then B cannot be celebrity.
        candidate = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            # If candidate knows person i, then candidate cannot be celebrity
            # So person i becomes new candidate
            if mat[candidate][i] == 1:
                candidate = i
        
        # Step 2: Verify if the candidate is actually a celebrity
        # Check two conditions:
        # 1. Candidate should not know anyone (except themselves)
        # 2. Everyone should know the candidate
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Skip self-check (person always knows themselves)
            if i == candidate:
                continue
            
            # If candidate knows someone else, not a celebrity
            if mat[candidate][i] == 1:
                return -1
            
            # If someone doesn't know the candidate, not a celebrity
            if mat[i][candidate] == 0:
                return -1
        
        return candidate
