Given a positive integer n, find the minimum number of perfect squares (square of an integer) that sum up to n.
Note: Every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of square numbers since 1 is a perfect square, and any number can be represented as 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + ....
Examples:
Input: n = 100
Output: 1
Explanation: 10 * 10 = 100
Input: n = 6
Output: 3
Explanation = 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 6 
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 104

Solution:
class Solution:
    def minSquares(self, n):
        # dp[i] represents minimum squares needed to sum to i
        dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 requires 0 squares
        
        # For each number from 1 to n
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Try all perfect squares <= i
            j = 1
            while j * j <= i:
                square = j * j
                # Update dp[i] by taking minimum of:
                # current value or (1 + dp[i - square])
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - square])
                j += 1
        
        return dp[n]
